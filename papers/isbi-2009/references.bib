	abstract = {Unsupervised image segmentation is an important component in many image understanding algorithms and practical vision systems. However, evaluation of segmentation algorithms thus far has been largely subjective, leaving a system designer to judge the effectiveness of a technique based only on intuition and results in the form of a few example segmented images. This is largely due to image segmentation being an ill-defined problem¿there is no unique ground-truth segmentation of an image against which the output of an algorithm may be compared. This paper demonstrates how a recently proposed measure of similarity, the Normalized Probabilistic Rand (NPR) index, can be used to perform a quantitative comparison between image segmentation algorithms using a hand-labeled set of ground-truth segmentations. We show that the measure allows principled comparisons between segmentations created by different algorithms, as well as segmentations on different images. We outline a procedure for algorithm evaluation through an example evaluation of some familiar algorithms¿the mean-shift-based algorithm, an efficient graph-based segmentation algorithm, a hybrid algorithm that combines the strengths of both methods, and expectation maximization. Results are presented on the 300 images in the publicly available Berkeley Segmentation Data Set.},

@article{Lindblad2004Image,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Rac1 is a GTP-binding molecule involved in a wide range of cellular processes. Using digital image analysis, agonist-induced translocation of green fluorescent protein (GFP) Rac1 to the cellular membrane can be estimated quantitatively for individual cells. METHODS: A fully automatic image analysis method for cell segmentation, feature extraction, and classification of cells according to their activation, i.e., GFP-Rac1 translocation and ruffle formation at stimuli, is described. Based on training data produced by visual annotation of four image series, a statistical classifier was created. RESULTS: The results of the automatic classification were compared with results from visual inspection of the same time sequences. The automatic classification differed from the visual classification at about the same level as visual classifications performed by two different skilled professionals differed from each other. Classification of a second image set, consisting of seven image series with different concentrations of agonist, showed that the classifier could detect an increased proportion of activated cells at increased agonist concentration. CONCLUSIONS: Intracellular activities, such as ruffle formation, can be quantified by fully automatic image analysis, with an accuracy comparable to that achieved by visual inspection. This analysis can be done at a speed of hundreds of cells per second and without the subjectivity introduced by manual judgments.},

@article{Ancin1996Advances,
	abstract = {Automated three-dimensional (3-D) image analysis methods are presented for rapid and effective analysis of populations of fluorescently labeled cells or nuclei in thick tissue sections that have been imaged three dimensionally using a confocal microscope. The methods presented here greatly improve upon our earlier work (Roysam et al.: J Microsc 173: 115-126, 1994). The principal advances reported are: algorithms for efficient data pre-processing and adaptive segmentation, effective handling of image anisotropy, and fast, 3-D morphological algorithms for separating overlapping or connected clusters utilizing image gradient information whenever available. A particular feature of this method is its ability to separate densely packed and connected clusters of cell nuclei. Some of the challenges overcome in this work include the efficient and effective handling of imaging noise, anisotropy, and large variations in image parameters such as intensity, object size, and shape. The method is able to handle significant inter-cell, intra-cell, inter-image, and intra-image variations. Studies indicate that this method is rapid, robust, and adaptable. Examples were presented to illustrate the applicability of this approach to analyzing images of nuclei from densely packed regions in thick sections of rat liver, and brain that were lableled with a fluorescent Schiff reagent. {\copyright} 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

@article{Wismuller2004Fully,
	abstract = {In this paper, we present a fully automated image segmentation method based on an algorithm that provides adaptive plasticity in function approximation problems: the deformable (feature) map (DM) algorithm. The DM approach reduces a class of similar function approximation problems to the explicit supervised one-shot training of a single data set. This is followed by a subsequent, appropriate similarity transformation, which is based on a self-organized deformation of the underlying multidimensional probability distributions. We apply this algorithm to the real-world problem of fully automated voxel-based multispectral image segmentation, employing magnetic resonance data sets of the human brain. In contrast to previous segmentation approaches, the knowledge obtained within the segmentation procedure of a single prototypical reference data set can be re-utilized for the segmentation of new, [`]similar' data employing a strategy of incremental adaptive learning based on the DM algorithm. Thus, we obtain a fully automatic segmentation method that does neither require manual contour tracing of training regions, visual classification of voxel clusters, nor any other kind of human intervention. Our application demonstrates that flexible learning by a strategy of self-organized incremental model adaptation can contribute to increase the efficiency and practicability of biomedical image processing systems.},

  abstract = {Automated segmentation of fluorescently-labeled cell nuclei in 3D confocal microscope images is essential to many studies involving morphological and functional analysis. A common source of segmentation error is tight clustering of nuclei. There is a compelling need to minimize these errors for constructing highly automated scoring systems.A combination of two approaches is presented. First, an improved distance transform combining intensity gradients and geometric distance is used for the watershed step. Second, an explicit mathematical model for the anatomic characteristics of cell nuclei such as size and shape measures is incorporated. This model is constructed automatically from the data. Deliberate initial over-segmentation of the image data is performed, followed by statistical model-based merging. A confidence score is computed for each detected nucleus, measuring how well the nucleus fits the model. This is used in combination with the intensity gradient to control the merge decisions.Experimental validation on a set of rodent brain cell images showed 97\% concordance with the human observer and significant improvement over prior methods.Combining a gradient-weighted distance transform with a richer morphometric model significantly improves the accuracy of automated segmentation and FISH analysis.

In order to perform high-resolution, high-throughput analysis of all protein location patterns, automated methods are needed. Here we describe the use of such methods on a large collection of images obtained by automated microscopy to perform high-throughput analysis of endogenous proteins randomly-tagged with a fluorescent protein in NIH 3T3 cells. Cluster analysis was performed to identify the statistically significant location patterns in these images. This allowed us to assign a location pattern to each tagged protein without specifying what patterns are possible. To choose the best feature set for this clustering, we have used a novel method that determines which features do not artificially discriminate between control wellson different plates and uses Stepwise Discriminant Analysis (SDA) to determine which features do discriminate as much as possible among the randomly-tagged wells. Combining this feature set with consensus clustering methods resulted in 35 clusters among the first 188 clones we obtained. This approach represents a powerful automated solution to the problem of identifying subcellular locations on a proteome-wide basis for many different cell types.",
